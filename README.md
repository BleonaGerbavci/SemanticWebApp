# üé• Cinematic Explorer - A Semantic Web Application for Movie Exploration

Cinematic Explorer is an intuitive semantic web application designed to explore a movie ontology dataset. It enables users to interact with data such as movies, genres, directors, actors, and awards in a visually appealing and structured manner. This project demonstrates the power of semantic web technologies by leveraging SPARQL queries, interactive UI elements, and real-time data visualization.

## üéØ How to Run

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Apache Jena Fuseki**
   - Ensure the SPARQL endpoint is running locally with the movie ontology dataset.
2. **Hermit Reasoner**
   - Use Hermit for local ontology hosting and reasoning.
3. **Web Browser**
   - Any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cinematic-explorer.git
   cd cinematic-explorer
2. Start the SPARQL endpoint using Apache Jena Fuseki and load the movie ontology dataset.
3. Open index.html in your browser to launch the application.
